# Agentic Web Governance Pack

Governance artifacts for tool-using AI agents—systems that can take actions across services (search, booking, purchasing, messaging, file operations, workflow automation).

This repository converts my long-form essay into decision-grade policy deliverables: a 1-page memo, a risk register, minimum transparency/logging requirements, procurement-ready clauses, and a note on competition chokepoints and market steering.

## What’s inside

- `memo_1page.md`  
  A policymaker/procurement-friendly overview: risks, recommended controls, and evidence to request.

- `risk_register.md`  
  A structured risk register (impact/likelihood, controls, and audit evidence).

- `transparency_logging_requirements.md`  
  Minimum disclosures and an oversight-ready tool-call logging baseline (focused on accountability, not model internals).

- `procurement_clauses.md`  
  Draft contract/RFP clauses covering permissions, logging, disclosures, incident response, portability, and exit.

- `competition_chokepoints_note.md`  
  A short note on steering risks, defaults, pay-to-play integration, exclusion, and lock-in in agent-mediated markets.

- `sources.md`  
  Primary sources and selected reporting used to substantiate key factual claims and context.

- `changelog.md`  
  Version history for stable citation and review.

## Why this matters

The web was designed for humans to browse and click. Agentic systems change the architecture of interaction:

- Interoperability and standards: agents need reliable ways to connect to tools and data across services.
- Security: prompt injection and untrusted content can trigger harmful tool actions.
- Accountability: liability becomes unclear when actions execute at machine speed across multiple parties.
- Economic shifts: advertising, traffic patterns, and platform power can reshape when attention is no longer the bottleneck.
- Competition risks: steering and defaults can create new chokepoints even without traditional UI gatekeeping.

## Who this is for

- AI public policy and governance teams  
- Regulators and competition authorities  
- Public sector procurement and oversight teams  
- Trust & safety, security, and enterprise risk owners  
- Researchers studying agent behavior and market impacts  

## How to use

1. Read `memo_1page.md` to align on the problem and control categories.
2. Use `risk_register.md` to prioritize controls for your sector (finance, travel, public services, enterprise SaaS).
3. Adopt `transparency_logging_requirements.md` as a minimum baseline for accountability and incident response.
4. Copy `procurement_clauses.md` into an RFP/vendor contract and tailor definitions of high-impact actions, retention periods, notification timelines, and jurisdiction/sector requirements.
5. Use `competition_chokepoints_note.md` to frame testable questions for steering, exclusion, and lock-in.

## Design principles

- Operational: recommendations map to implementable controls and evidence requests.
- Audit-friendly: prioritizes logs, disclosures, and governance interfaces over explain-the-model demands.
- Vendor-neutral: reflects ecosystem patterns and standards without depending on a single implementation.
- Updateable: evolves as protocols, case law, and market behavior change.

## Status

Current version: `v0.1`  
This is a living pack; updates will track major developments in interoperability standards, security research, and regulatory approaches.
